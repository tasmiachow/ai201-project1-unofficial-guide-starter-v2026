"""
Your test questions.

Milestone 2 asks you to write five questions your system should be able to
answer from your corpus, specific enough to have a right answer.

  ✗ "What are good dining halls?"          — no right answer
  ✓ "What do students say about wait times at Commons during lunch?"

Fill in `QUESTIONS` below. `expects` is a word or short phrase you'd expect a
correct answer to contain — you'll use it in unit 2 when you build a scorer,
and having written it now means you decided what "correct" meant before you saw
any results.

`OUT_OF_SCOPE` holds five questions your documents clearly don't cover. You
need these in Milestone 4 to find where your relevance cutoff belongs, and
again in unit 2, where `run_eval.py` runs them through the gate and writes what
happened into your run log — that's the evidence for criterion 3.

Swap them for your own if you like. Keep five of them either way: criterion 3
names a target of "4 of 5", and four of three is not a thing.

QUESTIONS = [
    # {"question": "...", "expects": "..."},
    {"question": "What do students say the average wait times is at Halden Hall?", "expects": "They are relatively short/non-existent the wait is about 8 minutes or less."},
    {"question": "How many hours outside of class do students say you should expect to put into STAT 150?", "expects": "Students agree that 5-6 hours are needed weekly for stat 150 outside of class."},
    {"question": "When is the earliest I can book a group study room?", "expects": "Rooms book two weeks ahead through the library site."},
    {"question": "Does BIOL 160 have a curve?", "expects": "No."},
    {"question": "How much can I print per semester?", "expects": "Every student gets $30 of printing per semester, which is roughly 600 black-and-white pages."},

# Questions from a different world entirely. Your gate should refuse all five.
#
# There are five of these because criterion 3 in criteria.md names a target of
# "at least 4 of 5" — you need five things to try before you can report 4 of 5.
# `run_eval.py` runs these through retrieval and the gate on every eval and
# records what happened, so criterion 3 has evidence in the run log alongside
# the others. They cost no model calls: a refusal never reaches the model.
